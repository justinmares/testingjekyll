#### Sample Script Excerpt

>If you can spare a couple minutes, can you please answer the question: What are the 3 biggest ongoing challenges you face as an ProfessionName?
>If you'd prefer to speak to me in person you can contact me on 555 555 5555 or you can reply to this email with a convenient time for me to call you (or I'd be happy to buy you a coffee anywhere in downtown CityName).

_Analysis_

'If you can spare...' is a way of telling other people you're not confident. Ask your question. It's a good one in this case.

'If you'd prefer...' also betrays lacking confidence. Give them the best two ways to contact you and perhaps your website address so they can research you if they choose to do so.

'buy you a coffee anywhere in downtown CityName' is actually the start of something excellent. If you're calling local businesses you have the chance to research them. Find out the great local coffee shop to them. Offer to buy them a coffee at that specific coffee shop that they likely frequent anyway. It shows you care, it's targeted, and it's a great way to meet prospects.
