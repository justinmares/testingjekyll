#### Bad Script
>Hi. I’m Robert Graham and I’m an internet entrepreneur working on software for deer management. I thought you might be interested in this project and I’d love to chat with you about it for fifteen minutes.

_Analysis_

The first part is information they don't care about or relate to. You should try to get them talking and stay away from talking about yourself. If they really want to know more about you, they will ask.

The use of 'I' is rampant and over done. Try to reform these types of statements to center around the prospect.

There is literally no value offered to the prospect, but you did ask for something _from_ them.

#### Improved Script

>Hi, I’m Robert and I run a blog focused on deer management. I am looking for a few people to visit, tour your facilities, and talk with you about your business. I can then write up the experience and link you up on the blog. When can I pencil you in?
