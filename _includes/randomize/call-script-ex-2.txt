#### Sample Script Excerpt

>I'm doing some research on the biggest challenges in the accounting industry, and I was wondering if you could help me by answering one simple question. I'm not associated with any company and I'm not selling anything, I'm just putting together this report for a personal assignment, and I'd be happy to share it with you when it's complete.

_Analysis_

The first part of the initial sentence is okay, but it isn't framed in terms of them.

'I was wondering' betrays a lack of confidence in yourself or your ability to deliver value to them. Don't use hedging language like this.

'just' is a meaningless word in the context of a scripted interaction. Make it feel personal through your preparation and enthusiasm.

'I'm not selling anything' is known the world over as code for 'I'm definitely selling something.' Find another way to say this or avoid answering that directly. Perhaps admit to working on some project in the industry, but don't make a product pitch or mention at this stage.

'personal assignment' is really vague and pales in comparison to language that might sound more like media, blogs, or something else that could offer the prospect real exposure.
