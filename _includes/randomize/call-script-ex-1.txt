#### Bad Script

>Hi. I’m Johnny Smith. I’m trying to evaluate an idea I have that will improve how banks handle digital security. Are you interested?

_Analysis_

It leads with far too much information about you. There is nothing targeted about this script to the prospect.
You might as well be talking about your fantasy football team. Why do they care?

Asking if someone is interested or thanking them for their time may feel courteous, but it reveals a lack of confidence that will usually hurt your scripts. This is similar to offering to do professional work for free in exchange for the opportunity. You are self-identifying as a risk. You won't get the job.

#### Improved Script

>Hi. I’m Jack Rodriguez. I noticed you guys received an award for security last year. I’m really interested in how you manage to provide such a great service to customers affordably?

_Notes_

Talk about them and get them talking.
