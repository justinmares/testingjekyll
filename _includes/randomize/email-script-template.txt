>Hi John,
>
>Your blog post on closing deals was excellent. Your idea to catalog prospect objections is something I need to execute more effectively. I also run a blog on best practices for insurance brokers. Would you be interested in a 30-minute interview via Skype or phone? Good luck with your booth at ABC this year.

>Thanks,
>Gary
