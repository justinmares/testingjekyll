#### Email Subjects

Cold calling using email is a different game from the phone for several reasons, but the biggest
one to keep in mind is the subject. Your prospects may only ever see the From and Subject fields
of your emails. The subject needs to convince them to open the email. Writing a great subject is
not unlike writing a great headline. You need to summarize, be honest, and create interest.
No wasted elements or redundant words belong in a subject.

#### Good Examples

* Start a blog: Interview < Business Name > for < Blog Name > 
* Write a report: 7 Ways to Improve X in < business > 
* Be honest and specific: Chat about handling < problem > in < business > 
* Name drop: Jackie Brown said to ask you about < topic >

  

These subjects are specific, honest, and interesting to the right targets. Some even offer value
to prospects up front. Try it!

Mailchimp has some [excellent data](http://mailchimp.com/resources/research/email-marketing-subject-line-comparison/) and [best practices](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/best-practices-in-writing-email-subject-lines) for email subjects.

#### Bad Examples

* Lazy: talk about problems in your business 
* Bad blind sales: Dentistry Practice Software 
* Feels false: Double your business today!
  
#### Final Thoughts

Subjects are something that you should test and tweak as you go. Many people may never see more
than the From and Subject of your emails, but you can use the volume to find subjects that work
for your market.
