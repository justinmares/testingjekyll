These areas of cold calling present a whole world of problems as it pertains to getting in the front door.  The first is where to find them.  Not all areas of a town have theaters of television stations, and many that do are hard to get in touch with.  It is important to know that most theaters and other artistically viable places are usually short on money and will not want to hear about products.  These are a tough sell but very rewarding if someones gets them.
