Calling a retirement home may be easier than most places.  Generally they are just watching the residents to make sure they are having a good time and their needs are taken care of, so getting them on the line for a few minutes of questions may be quite easy to do.  Just be friendly to whoever you get on the line and try to find the person in charge and you should be good to go.
