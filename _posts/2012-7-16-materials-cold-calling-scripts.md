Understanding your client and getting straight to the point is key in selling to a materials company. That company is seeking to purchase high quality products at a reasonable price. If you don't have much flexibility on your pricing, emphasize the quality of your product. Point out how it lasts longer or produces better than your competition to increase your chances of making a sale over the phone or getting a follow-up sales call.
