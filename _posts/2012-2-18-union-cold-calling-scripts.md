When making cold calls to a union ran business, it is important to sell to their unique mindset. Make sure your pitch includes how your product or service will benefit all employees, not just the bottom line. Companies with union employees will typically have someone responsible for taking sales calls, so time constraints should not be too much of an issue. Just keep everything business like but slightly friendly and cold call sales from union businesses should be no problem.
