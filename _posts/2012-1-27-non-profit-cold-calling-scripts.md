Do your homework before you tackle a non-profit cold call. Some non-profits are huge with corresponding budgets. Others are quite small, with few discretionary funds. Some are managed by a neutral party. Meanwhile, in other cases the reins may be in the grasp of someone very vested  in the cause. These are points you should ascertain before calling. They will determine your tone and perhaps the services you choose to stress.
