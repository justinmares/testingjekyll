Detroit is an area that has been hit very hard by the economic recession. Many businesses have closed, resulting in high call volumes to those that are existing. These businesses are anxious to get new clients but can be overwhelmed at times by the call volume that they receive. This is why it is important to be prepared to wait on hold. Call at non-peak times such as late morning and after typical lunch time hours.
