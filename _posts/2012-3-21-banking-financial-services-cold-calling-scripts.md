Banks might seem like cold institutions for many when calling them. They are infamous for using computerized selections. If you want to get a live person, you might need to break the system. Pressing 0 several times at the beginning of your call is typically a good way to get a live representative. Be prepared with any information you need to provide though, as you don't want to call back to reach someone again.
