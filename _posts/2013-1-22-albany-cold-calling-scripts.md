Albany is a large northern city that is the state capital of New York. Albany is also a large educational mecca, government hub, and agricultural center. Many local business owners in Albany are concerned about the environment, recycling products, and saving money on energy. Consequently, saving energy, recycling, and green products are a hot topic. It is also important to remember that timing is also crucial in any type of sales call. Focus on getting through to the targets at a time when they will more than likely listen to a sales pitch. Include a brief opening and get to the point quickly.
