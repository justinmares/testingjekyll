Alexandria is the seventh-largest independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia. It is also the highest income city in the commonwealth. Located just six miles outside Washington, DC, the city is largely known for its ties to the government. The downtown area is populated with boutiques, restaurants and theaters. Other than the small businesses, most employers in Alexandria and the surrounding area are affiliated with the government. Anyone calling on a business owner here should know whether or not their products or services comply with federal regulations. They should also be familiar with the government contracting process.
