Distribution companies deal with numbers. They know that the volume of their sales based on the number of products shipped must exceed their expenses. They also are very time conscious as they can lose clients with late deliveries. It is important to honor the time constraints set for any phone call that you set up with someone at the company. Honoring their time will show to them that you understand the business and generate goodwill.
