Getting someone from a graphic design company on the line may be an easy thing to do, as they are dealing with clients on a daily basis, but it may become difficult to keep them on the line.  Every moment is precious for them throughout the day, so treating them with a great deal of respect will help you get all of the information you can.  Ask the questions quickly and effectively and you should be fine.
