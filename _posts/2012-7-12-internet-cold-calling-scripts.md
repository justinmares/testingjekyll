Companies that that deal with the internet are usually quite easy to get on the line and collect numbers from, as they are already sitting at a desk ready to listen.  They may be willing to listen for a while but it is very important to get to point quickly so that they do not get antsy while on the line if they are not hearing anything of value.  Keep this in mind while making your cold calls.
