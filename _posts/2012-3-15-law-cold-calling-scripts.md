Calling a law office may prove to be more difficult than most other places.  They are usually very busy and are often handling very important cases when you would be calling.  Finding a way to get past the red tape and to someone other than a receptionist will be harder than you think, but with a little bit of persistence and offering a friendly tone of voice, you will be able to get through it all and to the person you want to talk to.
