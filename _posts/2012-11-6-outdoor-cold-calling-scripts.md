Calling outdoor places that deal with cleaning up parks and the like may be hard to do as they are generally out in the field.  Persistence is key in this situation and being ready for when you get them on the line is also very important.  Just know that you will have one shot at this, so you better make it good.  Have your questions memorized and ready to go for that lucky time when you get someone on the phone.
