Calling science departments at colleges or just businesses that deal in the scientific trade may be hard to do.  They are generally busy and do not want to waste time on the phones. Just ask the questions quickly and effectively and they may be willing to go along with your cold calling.  Do not try to make small talk at the beginning of the call, as it will probably anger the person you are talking to.
