The cold calling environment in the broadcast industry may appear intimidating due to the names involved, but the constant influx of advertising dollars makes it an easy industry to approach. When cold calling for the broadcast industry, emphasize the great ratio of potential customers reached versus dollars spent. When pitching ideas to the broadcast industry, stay professional and deferential of the big boys in the game and there will be plenty of sales to go around.
