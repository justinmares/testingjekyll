Communications professionals present a unique set of challenges and opportunities for cold calling.  Although they are relatively easy to get in touch with over the phone, they typically do not give their attention for very long. When crafting a script for a communications professional keep in mind that they manage large volumes of calls on a daily basis.  For best results be sure that scrips are clear and straight to the point.
