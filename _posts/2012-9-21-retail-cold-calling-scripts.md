Calling a retail store may prove to be very easy in the beginning but very hard as time goes on.  They almost always answer the phone but are reluctant to give you to anyone in charge as they are usually given strict orders not to let anyone past the gate.  Dealing with these gatekeepers in the nicest way possible could yield great results and get you in the front door with someone that can give you good information.
