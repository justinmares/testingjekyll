Calling a forensics research department may bring a lot of unneeded headache to the table.  They are constantly under a lot of pressure and the last thing they want to do is answer questions from a cold caller.  If this situation is on the table, however, the key is to show them that you respect the fact that they are taking time away from such an important job to help you out with your cold calling.
