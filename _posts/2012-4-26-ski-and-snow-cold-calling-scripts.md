Businesses dealing in ski and snow equipment are largely seasonal so it is important that you are familiar with their particular sales periods. When trying to engage owners through a cold call it is essential that you let them know immediately what you can do for their business and then give them options. Products on the ski and snow equipment market are constantly being improved and updated so knowing what features are new is a benefit.
