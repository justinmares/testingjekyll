Industrial equipment is not the most exciting product line to sell. Over the phone it can be even less exciting than in-person. This is why as the salesperson you should try to create a need. Take the angle of selling industrial products from a safety perspective. Point out how your product will keep their employees safer. This will make the company more productive as there will be fewer people missing days due to injury.
