Long Beach is currently the second largest city, after Los Angeles itself, in the Greater Los Angeles area. It contains one of the world's largest shipping ports and is perfect for such business due to its location by the coast. This city has a unique demographic when compared to the rest of the United States, with white residents in the minority. Long Beach's population has been growing steadily since its foundation.
