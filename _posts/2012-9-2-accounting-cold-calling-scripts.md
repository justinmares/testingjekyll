Accounting firms are plentiful, a simple online search will bring up the names and numbers you need for cold calling. Be aware that cold calls may not be welcomed, or accepted, during tax time. Between January and April accounting firms are insanely busy and it is probably best to leave them alone. The rest of the year cold calls should not be a problem. Know your stuff and keep it factual, we know how dry some of those accounts can be.
