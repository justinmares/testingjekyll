Many automotive shops are rather busy and will more than likely not have someone readily avaialble to talk to you right away. It is ideal to make an appointment with the owner or manager of the automotive shop so that you can discuss your script in full with him or her. Your script needs to include pertinenet information in regards to things that will benefit the company. Most mechanics are pressed for time so it is important for you to be ready to quicky rattle off as much information as you can in as little time as possible. Being prepared is the only way that you are going to be able to accomplish this goal.
