When calling a hygiene products and services company, don't beat around the bushes. They know why you are calling, they get sales calls every day. You need to get to the decision maker, and that's not always easy. Be polite and offer to wait on hold. Create beauty with your voice through being polite, friendly and accommodating. They can't see you over the phone, so first impressions are made through creative word choice.
