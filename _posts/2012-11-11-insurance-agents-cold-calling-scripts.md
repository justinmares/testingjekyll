Insurance people can reel off statistics and percentages, not to mention an array of anecdotes relating to accidents and fatalities, by the hour. That said, reels of numbers and fast-talking is not going to impress them. Instead, relay how and why your product, or idea, can reach potential customers for them, plainly and simply. If the interest is there be prepared to send over some charts, or a video. Statisticians love charts and visual aids.
