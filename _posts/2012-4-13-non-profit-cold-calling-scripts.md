Non-Profit entities are easy to personally visit or call. They are in the business of helping people, and this enthusiasm extends to everybody. One of the most successful ways to gain market share with Non-Profits is by taking it slow, and not using any high pressure tactics. The Non-Profit sector is not fickle, and will continue doing business with trusted vendors for a long period of time.
