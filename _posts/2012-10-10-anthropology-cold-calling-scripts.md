The field of anthropology can be a difficult cold call environment. Most of the money is found in a smallish number of collegiate research centers where many relationships already exist. If your idea is worthwhile however, and you can get a foot in the door, the potential rewards are vast with government grants providing plenty of buyers for your product or service. Be quick and to the point with anthropologists as members of academia are not usually fond of small talk.
