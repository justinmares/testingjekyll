Situated 35 miles west of Los Angeles on the southern California coast, Oxnard is a city with a diverse industrial base. Agriculture plays an important role in the area's economy, but so do biotechnology, communication equipment and service, finance and petroleum refining. Highway 101 provides access to major California ports, creating many import and export opportunities. In typical sunny Californian style, business owners are more laid back and welcoming. Casual discussions about business proposals and sales efforts would be more readily accepted than formal presentations.
