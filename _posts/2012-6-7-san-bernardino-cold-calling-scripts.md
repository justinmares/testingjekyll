One of the nicknames for San Bernardino is <i>Friendly City</i>. This provides an idea about the temperament of some residents, an ideal disposition for marketers. Government, retail and service businesses lead the economy in this city, setting another favorable characteristic for salespersons. The area has an eclectic group of people from college students, business professionals to tourists. Residents tend to be easygoing, thereby increasing the likelihood that they will want to engage in dialogue with you. Any sales effort would be remiss to exclude this area.
