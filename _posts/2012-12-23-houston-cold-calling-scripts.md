Houston is an ever-growing region. Often rated as one of the top powerhouses for the transportation, biomedical research, manufacturing, aeronautics and energy industries, many people regard Houston favorably for sales-oriented endeavors.  This large city is home to many companies such as Sysco, NASA, ConocoPhillips and EOG Resources. The city has a diverse population with a stylish appearance. Residents display Southern hospitality, increasing the likelihood that they will participate in a sales call out of courtesy. As with most areas, research can strengthen your cold-calling prospects.
