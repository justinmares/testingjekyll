Selling to hospitals is a very competitive industry, but a lucrative one as well. The key is to get the hospital administrator or their assistant on the phone. This can take some time as you are passed from one person to another. Their schedules can be quite busy, so it's best to try early in the morning or late in the evening. You may want to work hours outside of the standard to succeed.
