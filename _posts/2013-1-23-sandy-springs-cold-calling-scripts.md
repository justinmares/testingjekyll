Nestled in the northern suburb of Georgia, Sandy Springs has a burgeoning economy from medical to technology.   Any sales endeavor would find it beneficial to include a growth area such as this.  Aside from numerous hospitals, some of the top employers include Cisco Systems and ING. The people are caring and friendly with a Southern charm, which may be because many are accustomed to caring for others in the hospital. With some basic information on-hand, they are customarily open to engage in conversation with you.
