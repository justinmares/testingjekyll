Murfreesboro is right outside of Nashville and is almost as big as the music city capital. The people in Murfreesboro are friendly and carry the good ole southern charm on their sleeves. They make small talk and welcome small talk no matter the topic. They enjoy talking on the phone and especially welcome calls in regards to business. They appreciate someone who has the right information and who can bring in more business for a buck. They understand how hard it can be to make a dollar so welcome any fresh ideas on how they can make more while spending little.
