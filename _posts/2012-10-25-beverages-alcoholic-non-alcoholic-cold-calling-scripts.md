When you are calling to make sales to a beverage company, it is important to find the decision maker to talk with. Once you have the decision maker on the phone, give them an overview of what you are offering. Offer to provide time and material to help them with their decision by sending over additional material. Narrowing down their list of options and agreeing for a follow up call or meeting is key.
