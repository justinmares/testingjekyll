The public sector cold calling process can be a bit different from most others, as many public sector contracts require a competitive bidding process. However, cold calling with the intent of raising awareness of your product or service can be very beneficial to building relationships down the road. Most public sector offices have a person whose job it is to discuss sales so feel no time pressure on these calls. Put your best pitch together and there is some potential for progress in this field.
