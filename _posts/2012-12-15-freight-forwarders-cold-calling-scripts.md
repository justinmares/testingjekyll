When calling freight forwarders, be upfront about what you are calling about. In their industry time is money. Don't be upset if you get passed on to an assistant or a voice mail inbox. The key is to be personable and professional. Make yourself available for follow-up calls. Offer information the contact can review when he has time such as your website or the offer to mail a brochure. Value their time to increase sales.
