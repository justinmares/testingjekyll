Calling a music store may yield some good opportunities to collect data, but it is important to approach the situation in the right way.  These stores usually have high school and college kids working there, so you would have to talk your way to the manager.  Once there, you should be able to get the information you need to successfully complete your research.  Some stores are more hostile then others, so keep this in mind before dialing.
