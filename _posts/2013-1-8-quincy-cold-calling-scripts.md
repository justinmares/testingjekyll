Quincy is a large metropolitan city in Massachusetts. It is rich in history, and this is one of the things that residents like to talk about. If you can hook them with John Adams, then you can probably start a conversation about anything with many of the people in the city. There are several different neighborhoods in the city, and each one is represented by different groups of people, so try to research the people who live in each area before calling.
