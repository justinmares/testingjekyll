Archeology is a difficult field for cold calling. As in many other academic fields, the number of archeology purveyors is small and many relationships already exist. When cold calling an academic, focus on rational arguments and complement their work. It won't always pay off immediately, but it could lead to good outcomes when the archeologist lands their next research contract. It may be hard to get your foot in the door, but there are many rewards if you should.
