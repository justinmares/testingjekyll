getting through to a sales associate is relatively easy, because they have to answer the phone in case of someone calling to buy something.  Where it becomes difficult is getting the right person on the phone.  These sales associates are told to not let cold callers through, so it is very important to stick with is and talk yourself up as much as possible.  This may be enough to get you through the gatekeepers and to the right person.
