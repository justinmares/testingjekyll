Marietta is one Atlantaâ€™s largest suburbs, with a population over 50,000. With industries that range from manufacturing plants to military bases it is easy to see why so many are drawn to this area. If offering a sale or a service, it can be easily expected to face some minor opposition. But overall the southern friendly atmosphere will take over making talking to the residents easier.
