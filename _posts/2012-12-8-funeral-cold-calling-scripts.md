Call funeral parlors on weekdays, during early business hours. Remember their business requires a certain decorum. Assure the person on the line you don't wish to intrude if they are in the midst of a delicate situation. Also, let them know at once that you are reaching out with a product or plan to assist their business. Even if you have to call back you'll get points for understanding the sensitive nature of their business.
