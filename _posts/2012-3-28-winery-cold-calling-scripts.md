Wineries are easy contact and easy to access numbers. Often open to the public for limited times with long production hours, it may require creativity with keeping them on the phone. Research when the winery is open to the public and any events they may have frequently. This will help in finding better times to call. When on the phone, keep your script short and pointed while still creating excitement.
