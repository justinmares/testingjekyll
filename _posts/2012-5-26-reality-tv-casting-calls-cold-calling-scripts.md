Few people have their doors beaten down the way Reality TV Casting Directors do. Remember these people have seen it all. It won't be easy. Persistence counts. Once on the phone don't waffle. Be enthusiastic and be specific. Don't say you know this twenty-something with a great smile and nice legs. Say you have Julia Roberts circa the Mystic Pizza years, channeling her Pretty Woman. Then back it up with a photo.
