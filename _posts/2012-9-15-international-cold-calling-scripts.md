International cold calls are full of opportunity, and fraught with risks. When performing an international cold call, it is vital that you understand the laws and customs of the country of the business you are calling. Nothing will ruin a good sales pitch faster than an accidental inter-cultural faux pas. Due to the differing regulatory atmospheres between different countries, you often can find immense benefits in international business. Know your customers, know your product, and there is a definite chance of international cold calling success.
