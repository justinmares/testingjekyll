Bloomington is a city in Indiana that has a lot of farm town and family traditions. One of the major employers in the area is an energy company. Strike up a chord with the people you are calling by asking about new energy sources, and you can carry on a good conversation that will lead to your questions. The city also respects art, so this might be something to keep in mind as well.
