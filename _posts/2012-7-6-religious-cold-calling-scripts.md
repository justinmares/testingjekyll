Calling religious organizations like churches usually is pretty easy.  They are generally very friendly people that are willing to give you as much information as possible.  When calling, remember to stay friendly and do not be short with them, and you should be able to get all the things you want from them.  Just ask the questions and treat them with as much respect as humanly possible and you should be able to get the job done.
