Louisville, Ky is home to a major league baseball team as well to the infamous Louisville Slugger baseball bat. Also home to a number of interstates that all lead to separate areas of Louisville. One side of the city is home to an old amusement park and baseball field as well to the airport on the other side of town are all the local shopping malls. The city is large and can be easily lost in. Because the city is so large, they are always searching for someone who can help them improve their business by offering something more than the place down the street. Definitely worth making a call if you know what you are talking about.
