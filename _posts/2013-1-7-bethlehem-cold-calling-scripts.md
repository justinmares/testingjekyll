Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, consider by <i>Money</i> magazine as one of the best places to live in the United States, has a population of approximately 75,000 and a rather low crime rate. Nearly 80% of its residents are white, and the median age is 36 years. Its overall population has been tumultuous for the past 40 years, but resorts, casinos and malls will opened soon and are likely to have a heavy impact on the city's economy and population.
