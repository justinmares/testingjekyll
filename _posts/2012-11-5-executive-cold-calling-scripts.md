Business executives have very busy schedules throughout the day, and sometimes it might be difficult to reach these individuals on the telephone.  Usually, they have an executive assistant who will screen his or her calls, and the executive will only receive the phone calls that are important.  The best way to introduce a new product or service to an executive might be to start with a lower-level executive who can make an introduction.
