Restaurants are always looking for that new product to purchase that will make them a destination for their customers. As a salesperson it's your job to frame your product as the one item to put on their menu that will perfect the menu. Call at times when you are likely to reach a manager or owner outside of high volume dining hours. These are typically late morning and the middle of the afternoon.
