Round Rock is a quiet little town of less than 100,000 people. The residents are friendly, and they will gladly take more than a minute to talk with anyone who calls. The education system is one of the best in the state, and this can be beneficial if you are looking to talk to someone who understands you when you call them. Many of the people in the city are connected to technology and Round Rock is the headquarters of Dell, so keep this in mind when making your lists.
