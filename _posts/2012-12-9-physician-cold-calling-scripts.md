Physicians usually fill their days with patient appointments.  Talking to a physician on the phone can be quite a challenge.  In order to sell a new product to someone in this profession, a phone call will probably need to be made to someone on the office staff to start.  The staffer will determine if the topic of discussion will be interesting to the doctor, and then they will send the information to their boss.
