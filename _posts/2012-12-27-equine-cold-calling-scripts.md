Those who work in the world of horses tend to be busy and active folks. Expecting them to be available to come to the phone is probably a bad idea. Email cold calls are probably the best way to reach an equine specialist. They will sit down to read email when they have the time. When cold calling on those who work with horses, be sure to know your stuff. You want to catch their attention, not have them put you aside as just another guy who knows nothing about horses. Catch their attention with something interesting and new.
