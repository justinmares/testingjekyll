Milford Connecticut was once a popular beach resort for residents of nearby Bridgeport and New Haven, the town is now home to several large corporations including the shaving company Schick and parent company of Subway. The town is still a popular vacation spot, although events like the Milford Oyster Festival are now what attracts many tourists. The relatively small population still leaves Milford with a small town feel.
