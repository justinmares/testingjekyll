The key to cold calling people in the trucking industry with a service is to mention all of the positives of whatever service you are offering quickly, because these people do not have very much time to spend on the line because they have to focus on the road and getting to their location. Just make sure to keep your scripts short and use very simple language. Remember that monetary incentives appeal to them very much, so mention anything that might make them more money first.
