Selling to government offices might seem like you are walking into an office with an open wallet, based on what you hear on the news. That couldn't be further from the truth though. Government agencies must operate within a budget and it can be even tighter than many business working in the retail industry. If you try to gouge them with high prices, you will lose the sale and develop a poor reputation.
