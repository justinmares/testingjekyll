Yahoo! and Ariba are just two of the many high-tech companies that call Sunnyvale, California home. Sunnyvale is one of the major cities located in the Silicon Valley area where technology is a fast-growing field. Residents of this city are mainly employed in this field and tend to be younger than 65 years of age. A salesperson who is able to exude personality while remaining professional will appeal to this demographic.
