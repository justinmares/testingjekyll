This lesser-advertised city in Texas has budding potential. Though its economy is smaller than neighboring cities, Arlington has numerous opportunities in the retail, business, production and sales industries, making it suitable for sales-oriented projects. An interesting fact is that this metropolis does not have a public transportation system. This city is alluring to many for its simplicity, warm climate and hospitality.  However, when the humid weather proves too much, residents love to stay indoors. During this time, perhaps a resident will sent you an invite, creating a pitching opportunity.
