As owners of a brand new Children's Museum, as well as a best place in South Carolina to raise children, Business Week pick, it's clear Rock Hill is a place invested in its kids. So, make your Rock Hill cold-call list kid-friendly. Include toy stores, children's clothing stores, as well as other businesses catering to tots and older children. Rock Hill is a great beach and water-sport locality too. So, don't forget swimsuit stores, or stores that sell scuba gear, surfing gear and boating gear.
