A hotel operator is interested in the amount of traffic he can get into his hotel. This includes those staying in rooms as well as those attending business meetings or dining in the hotel restaurant. If you can show the hotel management how your product will increase the number of individuals visiting their hotel, you are going to capture their interest quickly. Products that are unique and affordable are what they are looking to see.
