Health care professionals are sometimes hard to get a hold of due to busy practices.  Many health care professionals are quick on the phone.  Keep in mind that most health care workers are highly educated individuals, so being direct and to the point can be helpful.  If the health care professional is not available make sure to have the receptionist schedule a specific time and date for an appointment.
