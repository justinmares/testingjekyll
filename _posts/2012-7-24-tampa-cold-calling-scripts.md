Tampa is a sunny city with lots to do. The seasons are mainly warm with a few days that dip down but most days keep people outside and in the sun. The shopping centers offer you discount buys as well as the more popular, expensive brands. Factories have workers buzzing in order to ship out items needed around the world and the restaurants and hotels are catering to the tourists and locals. The businesses who do suffer, welcome any comments and suggestions you might have that could improve their business. That is why cold calls are so important.
