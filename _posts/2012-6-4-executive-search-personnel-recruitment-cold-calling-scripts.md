Executive search and personnel businesses deal in volume. Their goal is to interview as many candidates and employers as possible in a day. This is why when selling to them that you should show how much you value their time. Offer to meet at hours that you might not normally work, to make it convenient for them. Respecting their time and commitments could increase your chance of making a sale during the meeting or after.
