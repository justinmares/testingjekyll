Edinburg is a small city in south central Texas near the Mexican border. The population is predominantly Hispanic. The city houses two small universities and several museums, as well as a minor league baseball team. There is no major industry in the area, although there are numerous small businesses throughout the city. In keeping with their Hispanic culture, residents and business owners will welcome visitors and callers to their community, but they should be prepared to spend some time, sharing meals and discussing business.
