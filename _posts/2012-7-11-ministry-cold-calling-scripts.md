Ministers are usually pretty receptive to phone calls.  However, they are very busy members of society who expect calls for their services.  They might not have time in their schedule to talk to someone offering products and services to make their jobs easier.  The first contact might be with the church secretary or maybe a lower-level minister at the church.  If the information warrants attention from the head minister, they will pass along the call.
