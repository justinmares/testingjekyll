When calling a construction company, the key is to emphasize how your products can save them money. Many products are similar in the industry. If you can show the company how your product costs less quickly on the phone, that can lead to a sale. Another opportunity is to show them how your product will save them time, allowing them to complete more construction jobs and make more money. Volume is key in the industry.
