Nurses can be a very difficult group of professionals to contact via telephone.  They are typically very busy with patients and assisting physicians.  In a doctor's office, the best way to contact a nurse is through the office staff.  The staff can determine if the product or service being offered would be of interest to the nursing staff, and they can relay the information to the appropriate nurse on staff.
