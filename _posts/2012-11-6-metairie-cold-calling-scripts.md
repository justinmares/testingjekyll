Metairie, Louisiana lies on the south shore of Lake Pontchatrain between the cities of New Orleans and Kenner and is home to one of the major malls in the metro New Orleans area. Known for it's nightclubs and bars, Metairie promotes a family friendly atmosphere as an alternative to New Orlean's French Quarter. The area saw a population surge following Hurricane Katrina. Business owners in Metairie are like most southerners, open and friendly. They will welcome outsiders into their business and will most likely be willing to talk.
