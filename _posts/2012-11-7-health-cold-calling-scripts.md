Selling to a health company is a very competitive business. There are many other salesmen out there, and some of them aren't above a small bribe such as merchandise or a meal to make a sale.  Recognize who you are competing with, and read who you are speaking with. Compliments to the receptionist and a small gift such as a bouquet of flowers will help you get through to that decision maker on subsequent calls.
