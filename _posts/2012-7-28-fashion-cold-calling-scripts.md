Fashion designers are extremely busy people.  They do not like their creative processes to be disrupted.  If a designer is in the middle of designing a new line of clothing, they might not be receptive to learning about new products and services.  Therefore, the first line of communication to introduce a new product or service would be the designer's assistant.  If the assistant believes in the product, they will pass the information to the designer.
