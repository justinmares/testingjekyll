Public relations professionals are easy to reach over the phone or in person, but the business is very fast paced. The best way to appeal to this market is to be as concise as possible while presenting the ways that you can offer them value.  Be sure to include free marketing services or public exposure on a blog, website or social media medium in your script to grab their attention.
