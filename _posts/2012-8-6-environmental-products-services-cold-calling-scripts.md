When you are trying to get time to meet with an environmental products & services company, you need to show them why you are worth meeting with. These companies are concerned about the good of the environment and society as a whole. When speaking with them on the phone, start with the big picture. Give some broad ideas of how your product can help them and their clients. Wait for the in-person meeting for details.
