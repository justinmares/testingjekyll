The janitorial industry is a fairly difficult market with low rates of new products and services, and low profit margins.  Owners of janitorial service businesses are typically busy and would have little time to talk on the phone. Make your pitch direct and on topic with an emphasis on how you can save the company time or money. There is value in cold calling businesses selling your janitorial services, many companies will switch service to anyone offering a better price
