Phone numbers for government agencies are easy to find. The challenge is actually getting someone on the phone. Typically you have to go through a lot of automated selections on their phone systems. Considering it is challenging to get a live person on the phone, it is important to have all the information you need available to share on your first call. Calling back will increase your investment in time significantly as waiting is common.
