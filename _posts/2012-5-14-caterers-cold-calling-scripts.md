Caterers are quite often busy at odd hours. They frequently serve meals at breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you are trying to get in touch with one to sell them products, the late afternoon may be a good time to reach them or the middle of the morning. Work with them to find out what they need to be more proficient in meeting the needs of their clients. This frequently means more efficient food products.
