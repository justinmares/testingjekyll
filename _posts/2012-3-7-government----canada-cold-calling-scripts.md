Getting through to a government official might take some time, but once you are there you should be able to keep them on the line to hear your questions.  They are elected by you, after all.  It is important to keep it brief and to the point, however, so you do not start wasting their time.  They have a lot of important thing to do and people to serve, so make sure you do not waste too much time.
