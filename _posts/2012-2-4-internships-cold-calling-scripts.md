When calling about internships, it is very important to be ready to collect information when on the phone. Have a pen and paper handy, as you may be directed to call someone else or send information in through the mail or email.  It can be challenging to find the person in charge of internships in a company, so set aside time for sitting on hold and being transferred several times during the phone call.
