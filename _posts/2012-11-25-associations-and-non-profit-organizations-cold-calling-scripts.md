Associations and non-profit organizations can range from very small to large companies. Considering they are non-profit, their staffing for answering phones may be limited. Try calling at hours that are less busy such as mid-morning or late afternoon instead of first thing in the morning or typical lunch times. These companies frequently use volunteers to answer the phones, so do not be surprised if you get transferred to someone's voicemail and wait for return calls.
