Fremont is one of the most populated areas in the San Francisco Bay area. The Spanish history of the city is very prominent, and the Gold Rush played a big part in the city as well. Some people will talk about the earthquakes that occur in the area, so if you can mention this phenomenon, then you will most likely be able to talk about anything else when you call.
