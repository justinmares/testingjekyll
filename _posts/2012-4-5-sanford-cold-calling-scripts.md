Sanford is a Florida city with just under 55,000 residents. Its local government is currently in the middle of a green initiative known as Imagine Sanford. The idea behind this initiative is to get residents involved in city planning. Agriculture was a very important aspect of Sanford's community for quite a while, but issues with the climate drew farmers away from the area, mainly towards southern Florida. Despite this shift, farming and agriculture in general are still an important aspect of Sanford's community.
