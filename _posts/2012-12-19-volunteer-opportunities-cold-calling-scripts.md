Cold calling individuals in regards to volunteer opportunities is generally an easier task than in any other setting because people are more receptive to volunteer situations. Whether you are looking for potential volunteers or inquiring about a volunteer opportunity for yourself, people will give you the time to explain what you are interested in because of the type of situation. Make sure that you are especially descriptive and exact in what is needed for the best response.
