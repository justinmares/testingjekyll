As one corner of North Carolina's famous Research Triangle, Raleigh represents a confluence of traditional manufacturing industries and time-tested blue-collar values mixed with an information technology industry that is quickly redefining the landscape of the city. Included in any assessment of the area should be the residents of the small Raleigh suburb of Cary, where a high percentage of affluent business professionals employed by IT heavy hitters like Red Hat and SAS reside.
