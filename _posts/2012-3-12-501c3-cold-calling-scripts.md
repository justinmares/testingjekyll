501(c)(3) organizations are private foundations and public charities. These non-profit organizations are tax exempt. It may be difficult to obtain the phone number of the appropriate person to call, but the main phone number of the organization should be able to direct you to the right person. These charities may give away money for specific causes, but for the most part, money at these non-profits is tight. You may want to focus on cost savings, but raising support or increasing supporter loyalty work as well.
