Orlando is well known for Disney World and Sea World and therefore has high expectations of locals and tourists. Business ventures range from Disney to sea life to other famous trade marks like Nickelodeon. Small businesses range from local restaurants to wildlife stores. Various subject backgrounds make for an interesting visit and city life. Nightlife is wild and by day, tourists and locals do their thing. Cold calls are great here because people love to hear anything that could make them more money either by the tourists who visit every year or by the locals who depend on these businesses.
