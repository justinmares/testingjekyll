Advertising is an essential part of any business, no matter how small. There are many different ways to advertise, online and offline. Some cost a substantial amount of money, while others are completely free. The best thing is to have at least four main sources of advertising going at one time. Start with one, and then build up as the revenue starts to roll in. If something does not work, change it.
