Vancouver is a rapidly growing economy with many important industrial and economic sectors including international commerce, trade, tourism, film, natural resources, and technology. The city of Vancouver is highly energetic due to its busy seaport and being a major gateway for pan-Pacific trade. The people of Vancouver are generally polite, but many are quiet and keep to themselves. It has to be taken into account that the city is multi-ethnic and multi-lingual in general. Research needs to be done before communication is made.
