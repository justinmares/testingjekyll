For courier companies, time is money. This is true with many businesses, but it's especially true with couriers. If you are calling to sell them something, be honest and just ask for a few minutes of their time. Honor that request and do not use more time than you ask for. If you respect the courier company and show that through respect for their time, you will gain their trust and maybe that important sale.
