Delano was founded in the late 1800's as a railroad town after congressman Columbus Delano. Up until 2007, Delano was home to the largest broadcast of shortwave radio for the Voice of America. The town has been a prominent center in many of the farmworkers organization efforts as well as similar political movements by Hispanics. The hot and dry climate yields little rainfall but is a good escape from colder regions.
