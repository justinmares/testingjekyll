Bellevue is often considered a technological center for the country. Nestled near Microsoft headquarters, Bellevue offers business opportunity in a small-town atmosphere. Many large, public companies conduct business here from Puget Sound Energy to a natural gas company. Don't forget the electronics industry as well as major truck and heavy equipment manufacturers.  Light rail helps keep these businesses connected with their big-city counterparts. With two interconnecting freeways, Bellevue is also a major trade center. Bellevue is the second largest city for employment in the King County area.
