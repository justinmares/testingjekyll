Calling a marketing firm will be pretty easy as compared to places like law offices and the like.  They spend their day on the phone or in person with people trying to drum up business for their company, so taking a few moments to answer a few questions will surely not be that big of a deal.  Just show them a great deal of kindness and interest in their business and they will surely help you out.
