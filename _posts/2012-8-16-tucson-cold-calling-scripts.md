Tucson, Arizona is in the Southwestern part of the United States. It's surrounded by mountains and is the sunniest city in the nation. The pace of life in Tucson is very laid back and relaxed. If you are looking for success when cold-calling Tucson, your entire approach needs to be relaxed and unpretentious. Instead of persuading and hard-selling, casually address their needs and how you might be of service to them. Put them first. The most important thing to remember - stay away from the hard-sell approach.
