It is very easy to contact a hospital, nursing home or health care clinic by e-mail or telephone.  When contacting someone in the health care industry, it is important to remember that the person will react only as to how the call relates to his or her job.  Therefore, finding the correct person to answer your call is imperative.  It saves time and a lot of effort for both parties. Advertising their services on a website or street sign using personal testimonials is the best way to get the word out about a health care facility.
