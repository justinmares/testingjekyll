Long Island is by far the most populous island in the United States, containing more than seven million residents. If Long Island were to be its own state, it would rank first in population density and 13th in overall population. It has a large amount of historical significance and is home to many universities and post-secondary educational facilities, many of which are privately owned. Quite a few famous musicians, athletes and politicians are native to Long Island or got their start there.
