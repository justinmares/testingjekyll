Glendale is not a big or major city but is a stop along one of the busiest interstates of the south. The area is small but not for the industries who live here. Truckers depend on the area because of the warehouses around here and therefore smaller businesses gather to the area as well. Cold calls are made possible here because many of the business owners love to hear suggestions made by those who call who have done their homework and know how things could be better if the right information is gathered.
