“The U.S. Government often has easily available telephone numbers and contact information.  Certain departments or individuals within the U.S. Government may be difficult to speak with.  Long waits on the telephone are common and sometimes the U.S. Government uses automated phone systems.  Remember to keep in mind that the U.S. Government sometimes has operating hours that are limited or do not adhere to regular business hours.”
