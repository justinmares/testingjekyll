Jacksonville is a warm city that is not just warm from temperature but also from the number of people there. The people are friendly and will talk with just about anyone. A business owner or manager welcome calls from people who can help with the business aspect of the company as well as how a owner might attract new customers. With every new customer, ten more might follow as long as the food is good, service is great or customer service representatives are friendly.
