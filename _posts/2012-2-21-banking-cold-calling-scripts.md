When you attempt to cold call a bank, it is important to realize that not all banks will be willing to talk to you. There are some banks that prohibit employees from taking cold calls from companies. If you find that an employee says they are prohibited from talking to you, you need to ask to speak to the manager that is on duty and try to discuss business with him or her.
