The key to standing out amongst the others is to take the person on the other end of the line into consideration. Customers are the number one priority of retail businesses. If a shop owner or employee is busy with a customer, they do not want to deal with a cold call. Ask if they have a moment, do not ask when the best time to call back is because they do not know when a customer will arrive. If you are told they are busy, respect that and tell them you will try another time."

If you can do a job for a company, and save them money on the process, your business services cold calls should do just fine."
